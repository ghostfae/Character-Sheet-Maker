# Character Maker
Create a character for [Monsterhearts 2](https://buriedwithoutceremony.com/monsterhearts) using the core rulebook.

## Usage
A console app that requires user input to decide on character traits for a new Player Character using the Monsterhearts 2 system.
The input is either text or number selections, depending on the dialogue.

## Progress
Currently, it is only in its barest form; it has no playable console yet. I am working on setting up the classes and character sheet before the user input is programmed.
Once this is finished, I may change it from a console app to a Windows Forms app. 

## Credits
Buried Without Ceremony for the rules and skins
